                        <p>I am M. Lipsa Jena, an enthusiastic and dedicated individual passionate about front-end development.

                        <p>My portfolio showcases a range of hands-on projects including a Weather Forecasting App that fetches live data using the OpenWeatherMap API, a Movie Search App powered by the OMDB API, and a E-Commerce website designed with modern layout techniques and engaging UI components. Each project highlights my ability to translate ideas into real-world applications using modular and scalable code.</p>
                        <p>My web development internship provided me with invaluable hands-on experience, further solidifying my understanding of best practices in coding, user interface design, and project management. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.</p>
                        <p>I am now eager to bring my skills and passion for web development to a dynamic IT company, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow as a front-end developer.
